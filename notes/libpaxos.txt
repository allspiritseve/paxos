the acceptor compares the proposal to whatever it has, makes it decision and sends back a "prepare acknowledgment", which the proposer has to check against its own proposal to determine if it just got a nack or a promise. the same process applies for accept requests; an accept request acknowledgment is sent back for the proposer to inspect. The proposer keeps track of all responses to determine the state of the round, as do the other nodes, such that every node can determine how a round has progressed; for example, a learner knows a value has been chosen when it sees a quorum of positive accept request acknowledgments.
